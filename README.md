# Walmart-Sales-Data
The retention of customer loyalty is crucial in sales as the customer defection leads to loss of revenue. Sales of the company solely rely on customers, but each customer has a unique issue and if the issue goes unaddressed, the customer switches stores and leaves negative feedback on the company. By analyzing existing sales data using Data Mining techniques, customer purchasing patterns can be identified in the variables affecting sales on specific days. This will allow the company to avoid customer loss and boost sales. 
The aim of this project is to identify the most precise Data Mining models for forecasting stock renewal and personnel needs.
